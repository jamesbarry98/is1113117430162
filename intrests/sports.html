        <h3>Sport</h3>
        <p> Watching, playing and talking about sport is one of my favourite hobbies.
            In the age we live in, a wide range of sports are accessible through the press of a buttton.
            The sports i play are table tennis, darts and football. I also watch these sports 
            as well as Formula One, Rugby and Tennis live on TV.

        <h3>Sporting Travel</h3>
        <p> I Play Table Tennis for fun but i also play competitively. I have represented Munster and have been capped 16 times.
            This has given me the opportunity to travel to multiple countries to compete. I have played table tennis in
            Germany, France and the UK also. During my visit to Germany i trained in the Butterfly Table Tennis School in Grenzau.
            This is the complex where the German club Zugbreucke Grenzau train and play. During my time there i was lucky enough to see 
            a competitive match being played. Below is an image of one of the clubs matches.

        <p> My love of sport has also seen me visit many stadia and sporting arenas. Actually visiting the venue of 
            a sports event is completely different to seeing it on a screen. The atmosphere of a sporting event is 
            incomparable. I have visited the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park in Dublin as well as the Allianz Arena in Germany.
