        <h3 align="center">Sport</h3>
        <p class="ex1"> Watching, playing and talking about sport is one of my favourite hobbies.
            In the age we live in, a wide range of sports are accessible through the press of a buttton.
            The sports I play are table tennis, darts and football. I also watch these sports 
            as well as Formula One, Rugby and Tennis live on TV.

        <h3 align="center">Sporting Travel</h3>
        <p class="ex1"> I Play Table Tennis for fun but I also play competitively. I have represented Munster and have been capped 16 times.
            This has given me the opportunity to travel to multiple countries to compete. I have played table tennis in
            Germany, France and the UK. During my visit to Germany I trained in the Butterfly Table Tennis School in Grenzau.
            This is the complex where the German club Zugbreucke Grenzau train and play. During my time there i was lucky enough to see 
            a competitive match being played between two top players. Below is an image of one of the clubs matches and a famous Table Tennis rally.

        <p class="ex1"> My love of sport has also seen me visit many stadia and sporting arenas. Actually visiting the venue of 
            a sports event is completely different to seeing it on a screen. The atmosphere of a sporting event is 
            incomparable. I have visited the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park in Dublin as well as the Allianz Arena in Germany.
