        <h3>Sport</h3>
        <p> Watching, playing and talking about sport is one of my favourite hobbies.
            In the age we live in a wide range of sports are accessible through the press of a buttton.
            My favourite sports to play are table tennis, darts and football. I also religiously watch these sports 
            live on TV aswell as Formula One, Rugby and Tennis.

        <h3>Sporting Travel</h3>
        <p> I Play Table Tennis for fun but i also play competitively. I have represented Munster and have recieved multiple caps.
            This has given me the opportunity to travel to multiple countries to compete. Through table tennis i have played in 
            Germany, France and the UK.

        <p> My love of sport has also seen me visit many stadiums and sporting arenas. Actually visiting the venue of 
            a sports event is completely different to seeing it on a screen. The atmosphere of a sporting event is 
            incomparable. I have visited the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park in Dublin aswell as the Allianz Arena in Germany.
