	<p class="ex1">
	    The following contains research on what are Software as a Service(SaaS), Platform as a Service(PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
	    and Communication as a Service(CaaS).

	<div class="section" id="section6"><h1>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h1>
	<p class="ex1">
	    Software as a Service (SaaS) products allow you to access almost any application you need anytime and anywhere. A third-party 
	    provider hosts the applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. This means that companies no longer need 
	    to install and run applications on their own computers. This eliminates expenses such as maintenance, licensing, installation and 
	    support. SaaS is considered to be part of the nomenclature of cloud computing. It is becoming very common in businesses.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section" id="section7"><h1>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h1>
	<p class="ex1">
	   PaaS is a category of cloud computing services that allows users to develop, run and manage applications without having to go through
	   the building process. It also means the user can avoid the issues involved with maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with 
	   developing and launching an app. PaaS services are hosted in the cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser. The main benefit 
	   of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section" id="section8"><h1>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h1>
	<p class="ex1">
	  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one 
	  of the three main categories of cloud computing services. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) can be classified as Public, Private or Hybrid. IaaS 
	  contains the building blocks for cloud IT and provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space but users do not have to 
	  actually buy the hardware, they buy on a consumption basis the same way as for example a consumer buys piped gas or electricity. The user manages 
	  their apps and data themselves.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section" id="section9"><h1>Communication as a Service (CaaS)</h1>
	<p class="ex1">
	  CaaS is a variety of different services that allow internal and external business communications. CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy 
	  communications devices. They are used to lower costs and increase efficiency in a  business as CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that 
	  small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford. They can consist of audio or video telecommunications. Communications software is provided
	  over the internet and so users communicate with each other via the cloud website. The service can be provided by different providers/vendors such as gmail.
