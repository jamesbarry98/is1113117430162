	<p>
	    Software as a Service (SaaS) products allow you to access almost any application you need anytime and anywhere. A third-party 
	    provider hosts the applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. This means that companies no longer need 
	    to install and run applications on their own computers. This eliminates expenses such as maintenance, licensing, installation and 
	    support. SaaS is considered to be part of the nomenclature of cloud computing. It is becoming very common in businesses.
