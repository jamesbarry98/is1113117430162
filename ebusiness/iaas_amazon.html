            Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) can be classified as Public, Private or Hybrid. Public 
            Cloud is Infrastructure that consists of shared resources among a variety of users. Private 
            Cloud exists and operates on a private network. Hybrid cloud is a combination of the two.

            IaaS contains the building blocks for cloud IT and provides access to networking features,
            computers and data storage space but users do not have to actually buy the hardware, they
            buy on a consumption basis the same way as for example a consumer buys piped gas or electricity. 
            The user manages their apps and data themselves.
